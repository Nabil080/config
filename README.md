`./export.sh` for quick setup

`./import.sh` to update the repo with local changes

### config.zsh
Using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), this should be inside `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/config.zsh`

### nvim
This sould be inside `~/.config`, use a nerdfont for icons I use [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/JetBrainsMono.zip). The background is transparent and will take your terminal background (images are cool)

### tmux
This sould be at the root `~/` and you should add the plugin manager as well
`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`.

Once this is done, go inside tmux and use tmux prefix + I to install plugins. (Ctrl+a then I)

### clang-format
This should be at your root `~/` to work on every subfolder, you can add custom ones inside your project
